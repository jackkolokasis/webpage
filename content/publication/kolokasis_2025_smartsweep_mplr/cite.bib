  abstract = {Using remote memory for the Java heap enables big data analytics
              frameworks to process large datasets. However, the Java Virtual
              Machine (JVM) runtime struggles to maintain low network traffic
              during garbage collection (GC) and to reclaim space efficiently. To
              reduce GC cost in big data analytics, systems group long-lived
              objects into regions and excludes them from frequent GC scans,
              regardless of whether the heap resides in local or remote memory.
              Recent work uses a dual-heap design, placing short-lived objects in
              a local heap and long-lived objects in a remote region-based heap,
              limiting GC activity to the local heap. However, these systems
              avoid scanning by reclaiming remote heap space only when regions
              are fully garbage, an inefficient strategy that delays reclamation
              and risks out-of-memory (OOM) errors. In this paper, we propose
              SmartSweep, a system that uses approximate liveness information to
              balance network traffic and space reclamation in remote heaps.
              SmartSweep adopts a dual-heap design and avoids scanning or
              compacting objects in the remote heap. Instead, it estimates the
              amount of garbage in each region without accessing the remote heap
              and selectively transfers regions with many garbage objects back to
              the local heap for reclamation. Preliminary results with Spark and
              Neo4j show that SmartSweep achieves performance comparable to
              TeraHeap, which reclaims remote objects lazily, while reducing peak
              remote memory usage by up to 49\% and avoiding OOM errors.},
