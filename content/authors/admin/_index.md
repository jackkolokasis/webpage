I am a 4th-year PhD student in the <a href="www.csd.uoc.gr">Computer Science
  Department at the University of Crete</a>, advised by <a
  href="https://users.ics.forth.gr/~bilas">Prof. Angelos Bilas</a>, <a
  href="https://users.ics.forth.gr/~polyvios">Prof. Polyvios Pratikakis</a>, and <a
  href="https://shbakram.github.io/">Prof. Shoaib Akram</a>. I am also a
graduate research assistant in the <a
  href="https://www.ics.forth.gr/carv/">Institute of Computer Science (ICS)</a>
at the <a href="https://www.forth.gr/">Foundation of Research and Technology -
  Hellas (FORTH)</a>. I received my Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees in Computer
Science from the University of Crete in 2017 and 2020, respectively. My main
research interests fall at the intersection of managed programming languages and
runtimes, memory, and storage systems. My work focuses on exploiting emerging
non-volatile memories and fast block-addressable storage devices to improve heap
efficiency in managed languages for data warehouse workloads, such as big-data
analytics frameworks. My recent work resolves the tension between garbage
collection and serialization/deserialization by providing a separate scanless
managed heap over storage devices. It eliminates both garbage collection and
serialization overheads without imposing any language restrictions.

I am honored that my current work, during my doctoral studies, was awarded with
the <a href="https://research.facebook.com/fellows/kolokasis-iacovos-g/">Meta Research PhD Fellowship (2022-2024)</a> and the <a href="https://www.cyscholarships.gov.cy/">State Scholarship Foundation of Cyprus (2020-2023).</a>
